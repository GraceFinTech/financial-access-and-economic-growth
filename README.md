Data Science Capstone Project 

Financial inclusion is defined as the ability for individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs – transactions, payments, savings, credit, and insurance – delivered in a responsible and sustainable way.  Financial inclusion is a key enabler of Sustainable Development Goals. Financial inclusion is measured through the following key metrics:

•	Access to financial services
•	Usage of financial services
•	Quality of products and services.
•	Financial health.

Economic growth is an increase in the capacity of an economy to produce goods and services, compared from one period of time to another.  Economic growth affects multiple aspects of a country, potentially including financial inclusion. It is typically measured using the following indicators:

•	Gross Domestic Product (GDP) – The total value of all goods and services produced in a country within a year. It is the most widely used measure of economic growth.
•	GDP per Capita – GDP divided by the population of a country. It is a measure of economic growth that takes into account the size of the population.
•	Real GDP Growth Rate – The percentage change in GDP from one year to the next, adjusted for inflation. It is a measure of economic growth that takes into account the changing prices of goods and services.

Other indicators that are used to assess economic growth include:

•	Employment Rate – The percentage of the population that is employed. A high employment rate indicates that the economy is growing and creating jobs.
•	Unemployment Rate – The percentage of the population that is unemployed and actively seeking work. A low unemployment rate indicates that the economy is growing and there are a number of jobs available.
•	Consumer Price Index (CPI) – A measure of inflation, which is the rate at which prices for goods and services are increasing. A low CPI indicates that prices are stable and that the economy is growing in a healthy way.

According to the 2021 Kenya FinAccess Household Survey Report, financial inclusion in Kenya has increased from 26.7 in 2006 to 83.7 in 2021.  Due to differences in methodology, the World Bank places Kenya’s financial access (measured by financial account ownership) at 79.2 percent as of 2021. The growth in financial access has largely been attributed to the proliferation of mobile money upon which digital financial services are built. However, no study has been done to assess the impact of economic growth or decline on financial inclusion in Kenya.

Accordingly, this project sought to assess the impact of economic growth on financial access in Kenya. The project aimed to use regression analysis to estimate a model to identify the causal impact of economic growth on financial access in Kenya.

Financial access has been selected as the dependent variable as it is a metric that has been measured across the years from 2006 by Kenya and from 2011 by the World Bank. The independent variables as measurements of economic growth in Kenya from 2011 -2021 will be GDP and CPI. A multiple regression model will explore the relationship, running on Python. Ordinary least squares (OLS) multiple regression model will be deployed to model the linear relationship between economic growth and financial access. This is primarily due to its efficiency in finding the best line of fit to describe the relationship between variables.
